# Lab 2 Report #

###1. What happens (in terms of the robot’s behavior) during the “delay(100)” statement?###
During the delay(100) statement, TODO

###2. What happens if each call to “loop()” takes longer than 100ms? What effect does this have
on your position estimation, and why?###
If each call to "loop()" takes longer than 100ms, the calculations for determining speed would be incorrect. 
If the speed is incorrect, then the calculations for updating odometry would be slightly off, which introduces even more error into the system.
It introduces more error becacuse we utilize the speed calculation when determing the x and y coordinate changes with the equations *d_x = cos(pose_theta) * speed_30*100 * CYCLE_TIME* and * d_y = sin(pose_theta) * speed_30*100 * CYCLE_TIME* 
TODO - this probs isn't exactly how we want to word it, i just wrote a basic idea :) 

###3. What is Sparki’s average speed (in m/s) when covering the 30cm distance from Part 1?###
Sparki's average speed is calculated to be approximately 0.02775 m/s  when covering the 30 ccm distance.

###4. In an ideal world, what should Sparki’s pose show each time it crosses the starting line?###
Each time Sparki crosses the start line, the pose would show TODO

###5. What does Sparki’s pose show after the first lap? Second lap? Third lap? (Without loop
closure)###
TODO

###6. Please provide a visualization of your convention for x, y axes—where they are pointing at.
Theta should increment positively in counterclockwise direction.###
TODO

###7. How did you implement loop closure in your controller?###
We implemented loop closure in our controller by using the line following code from the line following tutorial and having the robot rely on its sensors to determine where the track is instead of hardcoding in distances. 

###8. What are the names of everyone in your lab group?###
Benjamin Morris, Meghan Donohoe, and Gayathri Gude

###9. Roughly how much time did you spend programming this lab?###
5 hours? 2 labs plus on our own? idk 


###10. Does your implementation work as expected? If not, what problems do you encounter?###
TODO
