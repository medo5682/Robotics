# Lab 3 Report #

### 1. Describe one condition where your controller from Part 2 might fail. ###
### 2. What is the role of the position error? ###
### 3. What is the role of the heading error? ###
### 4. Why include bearing error? ###
### 5. Describe how you implemented your feedback controller in Part 3. ###
### 6. Does your implementation for part 3 work? If not, describe the problems it has. ###
### 7. What are the equations for the final controller from your implementation? What are your equations for 𝜃𝜃𝑟𝑟 ′ 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟′ in your feedback controller? ###
### 8. What happens if you alter your gain constants (the 0.1 and 0.01 values in Part 3.1, 3.2)? ###
### 9. What happens if you increase these gain constants? What if they become too large? ###
### 10. What would happen if an obstacle was between the robot and its goal? ###
### 11. (Briefly) How would you implement simple obstacle avoidance using the ultrasonic sensor? ###
### 12. Describe what would happen if the obstacle-avoiding robot encountered a U-shaped object like this ###
### 13. What is the name of your team? ###
### 14. Roughly how much time did you spend programming this lab? ###
